The workspace is made up of a few important areas.

- The file explorer and editor are where we will be spending a lot of time. Choose files to edit using the explorer. They will open in a new tab in the file editor.
- Run Project Button. We will use this to start and stop our Rails application.
- The Terminal is used to enter commands to our application.

## Set up the text editor

The Ruby global convention is to use 2 spaces for indentation. Lets change the default editor to use 2 spaces.

Click on the settings icon in the upper right side of the window. A preferences window will open edit the __Soft Tabs__ setting to reduce it to 2.
