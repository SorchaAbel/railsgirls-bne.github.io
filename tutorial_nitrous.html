            <p>One of the reasons why Rails is awesome is that it comes with built-in commands that makes it easy for
                you to get started.</p>

            <p>The <code>scaffold</code> command makes it super easy to create a concept by generating all the necessary
                files and folders which you don't have to worry about.
                It also generates database tables to store information and boilerplate code of how every module
                interacts.
            </p>

            <p><code>Scaffold</code> allows you to create a concept (eg: a user, post, comments) in a single command.

            <p>We are going to create the <strong>idea</strong> concept with the help of <code>scaffold</code> command</p>

            In a Ruby on Rails app, the user interface which is the page that the users sees, is often written in HTML
            and ERB. This code is stored in the 'views' folder under the app folder.

            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the language that browsers (Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer) use to
            display content. HTML contains many 'tags' that are used to create the structure of the web page.
            These tags come in pairs (an open and a close tag).
            For example, the main heading on your page will have <code>tags</code> around it.
            HTML tags use angle brackets < >.
            Your web browser uses the tags to understand how to display content.
        </section>
        <section data-background="#dddddd">
            <p>These are tags that we will be using for the app: </p>

                <li><code>link</code> - connects assets to your page</li>
                <li><code>div</code> - a container for other content</li>
                <li><code>a</code> - link to another page</li>
                <li><code>ul</code> - unorder list, needs a list of elements</li>

            ERB (Embedded Ruby) is a system in Rails that allows Ruby code to be inserted into files written in
            HTML or JavaScript. The Ruby code goes within specific angle brackets <code><% </code> and <code> %></code>.
            The server executes this as Ruby code and then embeds it in existing HTML.

        <section data-background="#dddddd">
          <p>
            In this tutorial, you will come across <code><%= RUBY CODE HERE %></code>, where the <code>=</code> comes
            after the <code><%</code>. This means that the contents will be written in Ruby code. This code will be executed and the results rendered on the page.
            For instance, if you want to show the number of ideas in your app, the code to render the number will be:
            <code>There are <%= Idea.count %> ideas</code>

            The next piece of this puzzle that makes the website pretty is CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). As before, HTML

            The <code>rel="stylesheet"</code> tells us the type of link, in this case a link relation. This basically
            tells the browser there is an external hyperlink to refer to. The <code>href</code> contains the address to the css file which is
            <code>//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.0.3/css/bootstrap.css</code> and
            <code>//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.0.3/css/bootstrap-theme.css</code>.
            Here, we are using the stylesheet called Bootstrap which is made by the people from Twitter.

            <p><code>{ padding-top: 100px; }</code> - this part is known as the declaration; each declaration has a property which is the style attribute you wish to change <code>(padding-top)</code>, <br>and an associated value <code>(100px)</code>.</p>
            <p>Declarations always end with a semicolon and declaration groups are always enclosed by curly brackets.</p>

            <pre><code>rails server -b 0.0.0.0</code></pre>

            <h1>Adding Images</h1>
        </section>

        <section data-background="#dddddd">
            <p>At the moment, our app can't upload images. We need to install a piece of software to enable that functionality.</p>
            <p>In Rails, there is a code library called <a href="https://rubygems.org/" class="external" target="_blank">rubygems.org</a>
                that contains many (over 9,192,436,958 in fact!) plug-ins that we can incorporate into our app. These plug-ins are called <strong>gems</strong>.</p>
            <p>Gems are basically pre-written code to perform a single piece of functionality. We use gems so that we don't have to write everything from scratch each time.</p>
            <p>By re-using gems in our applications, we reduce duplication and errors in our code. These gems are portable and can be used in multiple projects.</p>
        </section>

        <section data-background="#dddddd">
            <p>In your project menu, you'll see a file called <code>Gemfile</code>. <br>This has all the gems that came with the application we created when we used the <code>rails new</code> generator at the beginning.</p>
            <p>Open gemfile so you can edit it in the text editor. Under the line, <pre><code>gem 'sqlite3'</code></pre> add:</p>
            <pre><code>gem 'carrierwave'</code></pre>
            <p>The <code>sqlite3 gem</code> interfaces with our database, and <code>carrierwave</code> <br>makes it easier to upload images.</p>
            <p>Save the changes with <strong>File -> Save</strong></p>
            <p>Hit <code>CTRL-C</code> in the terminal to stop the server</p>
        </section>

        <section data-background="#dddddd">
            <p>In the terminal, run this command: </p>
            <pre><code>bundle</code></pre>
            <p>Bundler downloads all the gems that are specified in the <code>Gemfile</code> and tracks the versions to ensure that your project has a consistent environment.</p>
        </section>

        <section data-background="#dddddd">
            <p>Now, we can generate the code that handles image uploads by doing: </p>
            <pre><code>rails generate uploader Picture</code></pre>
            <p>Please restart your server. (<code>rails server -b 0.0.0.0</code> in the Terminal)</p>

        <section data-background="#dddddd">
            <p>Open <code>app/models/idea.rb</code>. Under the line <code>class Idea < ActiveRecord::Base</code>, add:

        </section>
        <section data-background="#dddddd">
            <p>Now, we need to customise the form we use for editing and uploading ideas.</p>
            <p>We're using the same bit of code to edit and upload. This is found in <code>app/views/ideas/_form.html.erb</code>.</p>
            <p>This code snippet is used in both <code>edit.html.erb</code> and <code>new.html.erb</code>, as the two forms are basically identical. This saves us some work! If you look at either of those pages, it just says <br /><code><%= render 'form' %></code>.</p>

        <section data-background="#dddddd">
            <section data-background="#dddddd">
              <p>If you open <code>app/views/ideas/_form.html.erb</code>, you will see the code <code>form_for(@idea)</code>.</p>

              <p>Find <code><%= f.text_field :picture %></code> (line 24) and change it to:</p>
              <pre><code><%= f.file_field :picture %></code></pre>
              <p>This changes the code from asking for a text input to asking for a file input, which makes it easier for our users to upload an image.</p>

          <section data-background="#dddddd">
            <p>Let's take a closer look at <code>app/views/ideas/show.html.erb</code>.</p>
            <p>
            In the code <code><%= @idea.picture %></code>, @idea is what we call an 'instance variable'. Instance variables are prefixed with an @ symbol. Each <i>view</i> file (files in the app/views folder), has a corresponding controller action, where the instance variables are set.</p>
            <p>In our code, @idea is set in the ‘show’ action of the Ideas controller. It's set with the code <code>@idea = Idea.find(params[:id])</code>.</p>
            <p>This allows us to use it in the view <code>show.html.erb</code>. It uses the Rails '<strong>find</strong> method to get the ideas for our app from our database.</p>
          </section>

          <section data-background="#dddddd">
            <p>The code that follows the <code>@idea</code> variable (<code>.picture</code>) tells Rails to access the ‘picture’ attribute of our resource (idea). </p>
            <p>Our new code, <code><%= image_tag(@idea.picture_url,:width => 600)</code>, uses the Ruby on Rails image_tag helper. This helper generates the HTML code <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag, but retrieves the image we want to display from the folder 'public/images' where our uploaded images are stored.</p>
            <p>Rails provide helpers that generates HTML code so that you only need to write vital code and not repeat yourself writing boilerplate code.</p>
          </section>
          <section data-background="#dddddd">
            <p>In the <code>image_tag</code>, we have also specified the width of the image width to 600</p>
            <p>Finally, the <code>.present?</code> after <code>@idea.picture</code> is a Rails method to check if the picture exists before proceeding in executing the rest of the code.</p>

            <h1>Fine-tuning Routes</h1>
        </section>

        <section data-background="#dddddd">
            <p>Our Rails app needs to listen for requests from the browser and provide the correct information through a system called <strong>routing</strong>.</p>
            <p>Requests from the browser are interpreted as specific HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) methods.</p>
            <p> This protocol basically defines how information (usually webpages or webpage components composed of text with hyperlinks - ‘hypertext’), is formatted and transmitted across the internet. </p>
        </section>
        <section data-background="#dddddd">
            <section data-background="#dddddd">
                <p>There are four HTTP methods: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>GET</li>
                        <li>PUT</li>
                        <li>POST</li>
                        <li>DELETE</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>The routing system in Rails ensures the app knows what to do when it receives each of these methods for any of the resources in your app.</p>
                <p>In this application <strong>Idea</strong> is modelled as a resource. A resource is something that can be created, read, updated and deleted</p>
                <p>For example, <code>GET /ideas/new</code> will give you the form for adding a new idea.</p>
                <p><code>POST /ideas</code> will create a new idea.</p>
                <p>Need more explanation on how routing works?</p>

            <section data-background="#dddddd">
                <p> Rails’ inbuilt routing system automatically generates routes for each resource. These routes map to specific actions (index, show, new, edit, create, update, delete) defined in the controller.
                     So, for each of our models, there are seven related actions defined in the associated controller,
                     <code>ideas_controller.rb</code>
                     These actions specify the appropriate response (a ‘method’) which is most likely to render the corresponding view,<code>ideas/index.html.erb</code>
                </p>
            </section>
            <section data-background="#dddddd">
                <p>If you look in your <code>ideas_controller.rb</code> you can see these actions and the associated behaviour, and the HTTP method that corresponds with each action:</p>
                <pre><code>
                def show
                    @idea = Idea.find(params[:id])

                    respond_to do |format|
                      format.html # show.html.erb
                      format.json { render json: @idea }
                    end
                  end

                  # GET /ideas/new
                  # GET /ideas/new.json
                </code></pre>
                <p> In this instance, <code>show</code> is the controller action that corresponds with the <strong>GET</strong> HTTP method. </code> </p>

                <p>We are going to change some of the routes we have set up. When you open the application it still has the standard Ruby 'Welcome Aboard' message. <br>To access our app, we have to manually go to /ideas.</p>
                <p>Open <code>config/routes.rb</code>. After the first line, add:</p>
                <pre><code>root :to => redirect('/ideas')</code></pre>
                <p>This changes the default page (root) that is returned when a browser requests your app to the /ideas page. Try it out now (don't forget to save your changes first, and restart the server if you've stopped it).</p>
            </section>
        </section>
        <section data-background="#dddddd">
          <p>Lastly, we are going to add a static page to our app. This one is going to provide information about the author of the app - you!</p>
          <p>Stop the server (CTRL-C) if it is still running.</p>
          <p>In the terminal, type:</p>
          <pre><code>rails generate controller pages info</code></pre>
        </section>

        <section data-background="#dddddd">
          <p>This created a new folder called 'pages', which you can find under <code>app/views</code>.</p>
          <p>In that folder, you'll see a page called <code>info.html.erb</code>. Open it up.</p>
          <p>You can customise the information in this page.</p> 
          <p>Start your app with <code>rails server -b 0.0.0.0</code> and add <em>/pages/info</em> to the URL now, you'll see the current content of this page.</p>

      <section data-background="#dddddd">
        <p>Earlier, you created a GitHub account.</p>
        <p>Now, we are going to add your new app to GitHub.</p>
    </section>
    <section data-background="#dddddd">
        <p>Open the GitHub website and log in.</p>
        <p>Click the <a href="https://github.com/new" target="_blank"><img src="images/github.png" width="80%" height="80%"></a> button.</p>
    </section>
    <section data-background="#dddddd">
        <p>Give the repository a name, such as rails-girls.</p>
        <p>You can also add a description.</p>
        <p>Choose the 'Public Repository' option and make sure you untick the 'Initialize this repository with a README' box.</p>
        <p>Finish creating the repository by clicking 'Create repository'.</p>
    </section>
    <section data-background="#dddddd">
      <p>Go back to Nitrous. Make sure you are still in your project directory.</p>
      <p>You can check this by looking at the terminal. It should show something like this:</p>
      <pre><code>&rarr; rails_girls </code></pre>
      <p>If you are not, use the <code>cd</code> command you learned earlier to change back into that directory.</p>
    </section>
    <section data-background="#dddddd">
      <p>In the terminal, type:</p>
        <pre><code>git init</code></pre>
      <p>This initializes your local git repository. Remember: git runs on your computer; GitHub stores your code online.</p>
    </section>
    <section data-background="#dddddd">
          <p>Let's add your code to your local repository. In the terminal, type:</p>
          <pre><code>git add .</code></pre>
          <p>The <code>.</code> means all files in this directory. So, this command will get us ready to add all our files to our computer's repository.</p>
          <p>Git has an intermediary stage before it saves any changes. This is called 'staging', and it allows you to make sure everything is correct, so you can commit (save) them.</p>
        </section>
        <section data-background="#dddddd">
          <p>You're now ready to make your first commit! In the terminal, type:</p>
          <pre><code>git commit -m "my first commit"</code></pre>
          <p>This commits all of your files to your computer's (local) git repository. The words between the <code>"</code><code>"</code> is your commit message. This tells other people looking at your code what you are doing. You can be more descriptive in your commit messages to describe what you have done</p>
        </section>
        <section data-background="#dddddd">
          <p>Now, you need to send the code to GitHub, so you can share it and collaborate on it if you want. In the terminal type:</p>
          <pre><code>git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/yournewrepositoryname.git</code></pre>
          <p>This makes a remote connection to the GitHub repository you've typed. We normally call this 'origin', as it's the original version.</p>
        </section>
        <section data-background="#dddddd">
          <p>Now the two repositories(your computer and Github) are connected, you need to push your computer's code to GitHub. In the terminal, type:</p>
          <pre><code>git push -u origin master</code></pre>
          <p><i>push</i> command uploads your code to Github in particular to the <i>master</i> branch.</p>
          <p>Your code is now on GitHub! On the GitHub website, open up the repository you created.</p>
